# Multiple-Linear-Regression-MLR-
I will apply my knowledge of the fundamental concepts of Multiple linear regression by implementing an MLR model and assessing its accuracy.
OBJECTIVES
  * Implement multiple linear regression in Python
  * Assess model accuracy by interpreting outputs
  * Understand what is meant by linearity and multicollinearity of predictors
  * Understand what is meant by independence, homoscedasticity and normality of residuals and how we can check these in our model output
